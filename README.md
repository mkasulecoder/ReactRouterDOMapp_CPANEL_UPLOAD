For deploying a react app on a shared hosting you need to create a production build. Production build/dist is a pack of all your react code and its dependencies. In most shared hosting we put our site/app inside a public_html directory so if we hit www.yourdomain.com it serves the code from public_html directory. Follow along with this short video to get your react project up and running in less than 4 minutes.

- Run React App Build command: npm run build
- Remember to zip the build folder to successfully upload the project to any hosting platform.
- Congratulations, your is now up and running.
